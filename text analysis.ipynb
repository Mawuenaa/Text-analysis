       "'Job interviews are laden with opportunities for humiliation. Who wants to describe their greatest \\nweakness to a panel of peers? Or be made to feel like a quiz show contestant with brainteasers like \\n“how many golf balls can you fit in a Boeing [NUMBER]?”. Unfortunately for job seekers, the rigmarole \\nis getting increasingly out of hand.  \\nDemands from hiring committees in the tech sector are piling up. That means more interviews but \\nalso more technical tests. Alongside coding evaluations come requests for essays, lengthy take\\nhome assignments and even days spent working with existing teams. One friend in the Bay Area \\nmade it through multiple interviews rounds only to be presented with a final challenge to \\n“entertain” the company’s leadership. There were no other instructions. She didn’t get the job.  \\nRecruiters will say that this is not being done to make life difficult for job seekers but because it \\nis growing harder to find the right candidates. The blame, they say, lies with job seekers \\nthemselves. Online postings make speculative applications easy to fire off. In the UK, the Institute \\nof Student Employers reported receiving a record [NUMBER].[NUMBER]mn applications for [NUMBER],[NUMBER] graduate \\nvacancies this year. Human resources software maker Workday reports that the number of global \\njob applications is growing four times faster than job openings.  \\nThis surplus includes those from candidates who are logging into AI chatbot ChatGPT to tailor \\ntheir application with skills they may not possess. Some even try to trick recruiting software by \\nwriting in white text — listing requirements they lack in ways that will be invisible to the human \\neye but picked up by screening software.  \\nFrom an employer’s point of view, therefore, adding new hoops for candidates to jump through \\nmakes sense. AI-assisted applications can mask poor candidates whose failings are revealed in \\nmultiple interviews. And the likeable smooth talker who sails through in-person meetings may \\ncome undone by on-site tests or work trials.  \\nAt some companies it is not enough to be good at your job, either. You need to show commitment \\nto the company ethos. Amazon is known for assessing candidates on its [NUMBER] leadership principles. \\nFail to prove your customer obsession or ability to think big and you’ll find yourself back on the \\njob market. The problem is that adding more interviews and tests exhaust candidates and \\ninterviewers and take everyone’s time away from the real work. In even more galling news, they \\nmay not even be productive. In [NUMBER], Google declared that four interviews were enough to predict \\nwhether someone should be hired. According to the company, anything more than that had \\ndiminishing returns.   \\nStill, this rule does not count the barriers put in place prior to interviews. Young job seekers \\nsometimes complain that their parents still believe it’s possible to put on a smart suit and hand a \\nresume to the front desk when looking for work. In reality, the standard process already includes \\nan online application, resume screening and online assessment before on-site meetings take place. \\nApplication tracking software like Oracle’s Taleo are used to filter out candidates before they get \\na chance to interact with anyone at a company. Unsuccessful applicants can be ghosted.  \\nAs the process expands, so does the time it takes to secure a job. Research from US human \\nresources adviser Josh Bersin put the average at [NUMBER] days. In fields like tech, it can be far longer. \\nSoftware engineer Rohit Verma has blogged about his experience securing roles in large US tech \\ncompanies. At Meta, he writes that it took about four months from referral to job offer.   \\nThis would be more palatable if it wasn’t for the tech sector’s newfound love of mass lay-offs. \\nAfter engaging in a hiring spree during the pandemic, the sector cut its workforce by an estimated \\n[NUMBER],[NUMBER] last year, according to crowdsourced site Layoffs.fyi.
